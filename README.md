# ToyotaCorollaPriceRegressionAnalysis
The aim of this project is to predict the price of Toyota Corolla according to various data. The data required for this estimation process was obtained from the Kaggle platform.
When the provided data set was examined, it was seen that it consisted of 1436 rows and 10 columns. When the data set was examined, it was concluded that there was a regression problem. And from Regression types; Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression 2nd degree (Polynomial regression), Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Decision Tree regression and Random Forest regression were used.
Regression measurement metrics R2 Score, RMSE and Cross Validation were used.
   And finally, visualizations were made to see the results of the problem more clearly.
 As a result of the evaluations, the model with the highest R2 Score and the lowest RMSE is our successful model. In graphical analysis, it was observed that this model was Random Forest Regression.
